Hello! I'm Immaculate Wanjiru Kimani, a Data Scientist and Research Fellow with a passion for using data to solve real-world problems. 
With a Master's degree in Mathematical Sciences from AIMS Rwanda and a Bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science, I specialize in statistical programming, financial analysis, and data-driven decision-making. 
My journey has taken me from the classrooms of Kenya to research labs in Germany, where I've had the opportunity to work on diverse projects in finance, healthcare, and education. 
Welcome to my personal website, where I share my work, research, and the impact of data on making informed decisions.
