Immaculate Wanjiru Kimani
Data Scientist | Research Fellow | Actuarial Scientist

Bio:

I am Immaculate Wanjiru Kimani, a passionate Data Scientist with a strong foundation in Mathematical Sciences and Actuarial Science. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science from the
Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology(JKUAT), Kenya, where I developed a deep interest in risk assessment, statistical modeling, and financial analysis. To further hone my skills, I pursued a Master's degree in Mathematical Sciences with a specialization in Data Science at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), Rwanda.

During my time at AIMS, Rwanda, I gained proficiency in statistical programming languages such as Python, R, and Julia, and I developed a keen interest in using data to solve complex problems. My experience spans various domains, including finance, healthcare, and education, where I have applied my expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and econometrics to deliver actionable insights and drive decision-making processes.

Professionally, I have had the privilege of working as a Research Fellow at the University of Tübingen in Germany, where I explore the impact of financial influencers on financial inclusion and literacy. And over time I have developed my project management skills as I work as a Project Manager with Lizzette Agencies. Additionally, I have served as a Data Science Intern at the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), contributing to the improvement of the Education Management Information System (EMIS) for refugee contexts. 

Personal Values:

At the core of my work is a belief in the power of data to transform lives. I am driven by the desire to uncover insights that can lead to meaningful changes, particularly in underprivileged communities and women. My passion for data science stems from the realization that data, when properly harnessed, has the potential to solve some of the world's most pressing challenges. Whether it’s through improving financial access for low-income populations or enhancing educational outcomes for students, I am committed to using my skills to make a positive impact.

I value integrity, curiosity, and continuous learning. I approach every problem with a mindset that seeks to understand not just the "how" but the "why" behind the data. This inquisitiveness drives me to dig deeper into issues, challenging assumptions and seeking innovative solutions.

Interests Outside of Work:

Beyond my professional pursuits, I have a variety of interests that keep me balanced and inspired. I am an avid reader, particularly of books on social-behavioral structures and data-driven decision-making. I also enjoy hiking and exploring new places, which allows me to recharge and find fresh perspectives. And when I feel overwhelmed, I gather my vocal cords and sing to the best of my conductors' ability.

I am deeply committed to giving back to the community and have been involved in various volunteer activities, including mentoring young students interested in STEM fields and participating in data science workshops aimed at empowering women in tech. My volunteer work reflects my belief in the importance of education and the role it plays in unlocking potential and fostering growth.
